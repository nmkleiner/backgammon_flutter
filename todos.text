-look at backgammon vue for logic tips.


V-dices entity
V-cell entity
V-dices animations
V-exit cells outside of board

V-set soldier dimensions in boardconstants

V-calculate possible moves based on:
    V-currentTurn
    V-opponent houses
    V-dices
    v-isGameEnd
    V-hasEatenSoldiers

-game logic provider:
-open gameService from backgammon-vue and create a list of steps to implement

-cell click
    V-  nicer colors for possibleMove cells
    V-   recalculate possible moves after move
    V-   reset possibleMove cells
    V-   don't reuse used dices. (supposed to be already implemented, verify!)
    V-   possibleMove Cells are not correct
    -   end turn.
V-switch turns
V-eating soldiers
V-exiting board
V-identify game over, winner
